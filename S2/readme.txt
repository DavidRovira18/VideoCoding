Video Coding Seminar 2.

This seminar was done in PyCharm using a Python WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) interpreter. Works with a Ubuntu Windows console and it should work with Ubuntu when installing the necesary packages. 
The project relies on subprocess package for executing ffmpeg commands.

With all the video files added in the GitHub the code should only print the number of streams of the BigBuckBunny_packaged.mp4 file. If videos are not added, the code needs a video file 
called BigBuckBunny.mpeg to start working and all other videos will be created automatically afterwards.
