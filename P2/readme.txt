Video Coding Practice 2.

This practice was done in PyCharm using a Python WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) interpreter. Works with a Ubuntu Windows console and it should work with Ubuntu when installing the necesary packages. 
The project relies on several packages:
 - filedialog: From tkinter to open file dialogs to open and save images.
 - subprocess: for executing ffmpeg commands.
 - numpy: for mathematical purposes.

Relies in the P1 code, make sure that P1 is in another folder called P1 on the root directory for the correct functionality. 

Also it is suitable to run interactively via a simple menu created to ease the use of the app.
