Video Coding SP3.

This seminar practice was done in PyCharm using a Python WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) interpreter. Works with a Ubuntu Windows console and it should work with Ubuntu when installing the necesary packages. 
The project relies on subprocess package for executing ffmpeg commands.

Also, there is a GUI (see screenshots) to convert videos to mp4 or mpeg. This GUI is programmed using kivy python library.
